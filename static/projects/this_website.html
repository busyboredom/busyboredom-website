    I am frequently frustrated by the ineficiency and fragmentation of modern web development. To
    implement client side routing for a more responsive user experience, for example,
    you would typically be encouraged to adopt a JavaScript framework like Vue. Let me walk you though my experience
    with that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Opened up the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide">Vue v2 Guide</a></li>
    <li>Realized that Vue has its own ways to do:
      <ul>
        <li>Component registration (and communication)</li>
        <li>Event handling</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Unit testing</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Looked for slimmer alternatives (oh hey, maybe react?).</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    <i>You can imagine how my React experience went.</i>
  </p>
     
  <p>
    My beef with this situation wasn't an aversion to learning -- it was a fear that <em>after adopting
    one of these technoligies, I might be stuck with it.</em> What if it's no longer maintained in 5 
    years? What if I need help maintaining it, but can't find people who know my specific "stack" of
    frameworks anymore? What if I just want a different feature set? Commitment is scary, and web
    development is full of it.
