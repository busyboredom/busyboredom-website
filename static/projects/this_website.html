  <h1>This Website</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>This is a website for purists.</p>

    <p>
      The sluggish performance, common 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a> and incredible
      fragmentation of modern web development prompted me to try something new. To force myself out
      of the current ecosystem, I set out to build a modern website without JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      I got pretty close. Aside from JavaScript bindings generated with 
      <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a> for the necessary DOM 
      access, <em>this website uses only 8 lines of JavaScript</em>. The rest is done in 
      <a href="https://WebAssembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, accomplishing rudamentary client-side
      routing and interactivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The entire website -- including the <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix</a>-based backend -- 
      compiles to a single 9MB executable for easy deployment. You can view the source code 
      <a href="https://github.com/busyboredom/busyboredom-website">here</a> if you're thinking of
      doing something similar yourself.
    </p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  
  <p>
    I am frequently frustrated by the ineficiency and fragmentation of modern web development. To
    implement client side routing for a more responsive user experience, for example,
    you would typically be encouraged to adopt a JavaScript framework like Vue. Let me walk you 
    though my experience with that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Opened up the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide">Vue v2 Guide</a></li>
    <li>Realized that Vue has its own ways to do:
      <ul>
        <li>Component registration (and communication)</li>
        <li>Event handling</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Unit testing</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Looked for slimmer alternatives (oh hey, maybe <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>?).
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    <i>You can imagine how my React experience went.</i>
  </p>
     
  <p>
    My beef with this situation wasn't an aversion to learning -- it was a fear that <em>after 
    adopting one of these technoligies, I might be stuck with it.</em> What if it's no longer 
    maintained in 5 years? What if I need help maintaining it, but can't find people who know my 
    specific "stack" of frameworks anymore? What if I just want a different feature set? 
    Commitment is scary, and web development is full of it.

    Making matters worse, these dependencies come with dependencies of their own and will need 
    helper libraries and plugins to accomplish many of the tasks you require. You will likely
    end up with some combination of 
    
    <ul>
      <li>vue-router</li>
      <li>vuex</li>
      <li>vue-custom-element</li>
      <li>vue-touch</li>
      <li>NPM</li>
      <li>Webpack</li>
    </ul>

    along with any number of miscelanious dependencies you might find recommended on Stack Overflow
    for whatever feature you're trying to implement. Small things here and there eventually add
    up, and webpages have gotten big. The average webpage surpassed the original DOOM game in size 
    <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/average-webpage-now-size-original-doom/">
      back in 2016
    </a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a 
    <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/page-weight#introduction">great writeup</a> 
    by HTTP Archive on why web bloat and complexity is a problem if you'd like to learn more. 
  </p>

  <h2>The Solution</h2>

  <p>
    If the problem is the ecosystem as a whole pushing us towards unsustainable development 
    practices, then solution is to get away from the ecosystem. Instead of JavaScript, this website
    was created using WebAssembly compiled from <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. 
    Tools like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and NPM were left on the sidelines
    while I made my own interactive elements and relied on the Rust-native dependency manager and
    build tool, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/">Cargo</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    WebAssembly, however, lacks many of the privilages of JavaScript (like DOM access). To get
    around this, a total of 8 lines of JavaScript were used to load the WebAssembly, and some more
    auto-generated as glue code by wasm-bindgen (mentioned earlier). These 8 lines load the glue
    and pass events to my WebAssembly.
  </p>

  <pre>
    <code>
// Import the init function from the 
// generated JS bindings and call it.
import init, * as busy from '/api/bindings';
async function run() {
  // Load the wasm file
  await init('/api/wasm');
}
run();

// Store wasm functions in window to make 
// them accessible outside this script.
window.busy = busy;

// Add popstate event handler.
window.onpopstate = function(event) {
  if (event.state) {
    window.busy.route(event.state);
  }
};
    </code>
  </pre>
  
  <p>
    With this out of the way, I was able to start working on the fun stuff. Routing boiled down
    to a very simple function run on every request.
  </p>

  <pre>
    <code>
/// Get current URL and load the resulting page.
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn route(rt: &str) {
    match rt {
        "/" => spawn_local(welcome()),
        "/welcome" => spawn_local(welcome()),
        "/resume" => spawn_local(resume()),
        "/contact" => spawn_local(contact()),
        "/projects/this_website" => 
            spawn_local(this_website()),
        _ => spawn_local(error_404()),
    }
}
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, browser history is manipulated from within each page's associated function as 
    shown below for the welcome page.
  </p>

  <pre>
    <code>
if history
    .state().expect("Could not get history state") != "/welcome" {
    history
        .push_state_with_url(
            &JsValue::from_str("/welcome"), 
            "Welcome!", 
            Some("/welcome"))
        .expect("Could not push state (with URL) to history");
}
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    The actual content of pages (when not loaded on first contact) is retrieved as-needed by HTTP 
    request.
  </p>

  <pre>
    <code>
let mut req = RequestInit::new();
req.method("GET");
let request =
    Request::new_with_str_and_init("/api/welcome", &req)
        .expect("Request could not be created");
request
    .headers()
    .set("Accept", "text/html")
    .expect("Headers could not be set");

let response = JsFuture::from(window.fetch_with_request(&request))
    .await
    .expect("Could not unwrap response");

// `response` is a `Response` object.
assert!(response.is_instance_of::&ltResponse&gt());
let resp: Response = response.dyn_into().unwrap();

// Convert this other `Promise` into a rust `Future`.
let page = JsFuture::from(resp.text().unwrap())
    .await
    .unwrap()
    .as_string()
    .unwrap();

// Show the new content.
document
    .get_element_by_id("page")
    .unwrap()
    .set_inner_html(&page);
    </code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    The frontend is served by an actix-web backend, with the entire frontend compiled seperately 
    and embedded in the final executable using the <code>include_bytes!()</code> macro. while this
    method is less than ideal for compile times, it makes single-file deployment a possibility.
  </p>

  <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>

  <p>
     This has been a fun project, and I plan on using this website to host my projects for a long 
     time. That said, <em>I would never use a setup like this for a serious production website</em>.
     As cool as this is, it's just too far from standard.
