  <h1>This Website</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>This is a website for purists.</p>

    <p>
      The sluggish performance, common 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a> and incredible
      fragmentation of modern web development prompted me to try something new. To force myself out
      of the current ecosystem, I set out to build a modern website without Javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
      I got pretty close. Aside from javascript bindings generated with 
      <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a> for the necessary DOM 
      access, <em>this website uses only 7 lines of Javascript</em>. The rest is done in 
      <a href="https://webassembly.org/">webassembly</a>, accomplishing rudamentary client-side
      routing and interactivity.

      The entire website -- including the <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix-based</a> backend -- 
      compiles to a single 9MB executable for easy deployment.
    </p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  
  <p>
    I am frequently frustrated by the ineficiency and fragmentation of modern web development. To
    implement client side routing for a more responsive user experience, for example,
    you would typically be encouraged to adopt a JavaScript framework like Vue. Let me walk you 
    though my experience with that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Opened up the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide">Vue v2 Guide</a></li>
    <li>Realized that Vue has its own ways to do:
      <ul>
        <li>Component registration (and communication)</li>
        <li>Event handling</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Unit testing</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Looked for slimmer alternatives (oh hey, maybe <a href=""https://reactjs.org/>React?</a>).
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    <i>You can imagine how my React experience went.</i>
  </p>
     
  <p>
    My beef with this situation wasn't an aversion to learning -- it was a fear that <em>after 
    adopting one of these technoligies, I might be stuck with it.</em> What if it's no longer 
    maintained in 5 years? What if I need help maintaining it, but can't find people who know my 
    specific "stack" of frameworks anymore? What if I just want a different feature set? 
    Commitment is scary, and web development is full of it.

    Making matters worse, these dependencies come with dependencies of their own and will need 
    helper libraries and plugins to accomplish many of the tasks you require. You will likely
    end up with some combination of 
    
    <ul>
      <li>vue-router</li>
      <li>vuex</li>
      <li>vue-custom-element</li>
      <li>vue-touch</li>
      <li>NPM</li>
      <li>Webpack</li>
    </ul>

    along with any number of miscelanious dependencies you might find recommended on Stack Overflow
    for whatever feature you're trying to implement. Small things here and there eventually add
    up, and webpages have gotten big. The average webpage surpassed the original DOOM game in size 
    <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/average-webpage-now-size-original-doom/">
      back in 2016
    </a>.

    There's a 
    <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/page-weight#introduction">great writeup</a> 
    by HTTP Archive on why web bloat and complexity is a problem if you'd like to learn more.
