    <h2>Summary</h2>
  
    <p>
      I went into industrial automation out of college, so this is a bit more than one
      project. It's how I paid my loans off, and <i>oh boy</i> does it take a lot of programming
      to pay off a degree nowadays. 
      <br><br>
      At <a href="http://www.umc-oscar.com">Universal Machine and Engineering</a>, the
      role of a controls engineer is to program machines to do the tasks expected of them.
      Those tasks range from putting bottles in boxes to cutting up lobsters -- the
      client specifies the task, the mechanical guys build a machine, and the controls
      guys bring it to life.
