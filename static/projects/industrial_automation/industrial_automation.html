    <h2>Summary</h2>
  
    <p>
      I went into industrial automation out of college, so this is a bit more than one
      project. It's how I paid my loans off, and <i>oh boy</i> does it take a lot of
      programming to pay off a degree nowadays. Luckily, industrial automation is a
      rewarding field to work in; it makes people's work go farther, so that someday we
      might not have to work so hard.
      <br><br>
      At <a href="http://www.umc-oscar.com">Universal Machine and Engineering</a> (UMEC), the
      role of a controls engineer is to program machines to do the tasks expected of them.
      Those tasks range from putting bottles in boxes to cutting up lobsters -- the
      client specifies the task, the mechanical guys build a machine, and the controls
      guys bring it to life.
      <br><br>
      This page lists a few of the industrial automation jobs I have had a hand in. 
    </p>

    <h2>Autoinjector Sleever</h2>

    <div style="width:100%; height:0; padding-top:56.25%; position:relative;">
      <video controls playsinline preload="auto" style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%;">

    <p>
      This is the project shown in the video at the top of this page. The machine's task
      was simple: 
      
      <ol>
        <li>Print some info on a plastic sleeve.</li>
        <li>Put it on an injector.</li>
        <li>Shrink it on tight.</li>
      </ol>

      But as with all large projects, making it work isn't quite as easy as those 3 steps
      sound. To meet the client's neets, the machine also needed to:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Verify the information printed using optical character recognition.</li>
        <li>Eject bad prints before shrinking.</li>
        <li>Reject bad parts (for faulty shrinkage) after shrinking.</li>
        <li>Load injectors from trays.</li>
        <li>Allow continuous operation during loading and unloading.</li>
        <li>
          Record temperature, speed, rejects, operator credentials, etc. in a database.
        </li>
        <li>Do it all at 60 parts per minute.</li>
      </ul>

      There were many other requirements, but this was the bulk of it. We used two 6-axis
      Epson robots to load the injectors from trays inserted by an operator, Cognex
      cameras to read the print and inspect the shrinkage, pneumatic pistons for
      ejecting/rejecting parts and an Epson SCARA robot for unloading the sleeved
      injectors into bins. Data was pushed to Microsoft SQL Server while inspection images
      were sent to an FTP server, and it was all controlled by an Allen-Bradley PLC.

    <h2>Vial Cartoner</h2>

    <div style="width:100%; height:0; padding-top:56.25%; position:relative;">
      <video controls playsinline preload="auto" style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%;"> 
        <source

    </div>

    <p>
      This was my first project at UMEC. The task was to:

      <ol>
        <li>Fold boxes (i.e. cartons).</li>
        <li>Verify the carton barcodes using an ID40 barcode scanner.</li>
        <li>Load vials into cartons two at a time.</li>
        <li>Fold the cartons shut.</li>
        <li>Reject bad parts (empty carton, bad barcode read, etc.).</li>
        <li>Place 60 vials per minute.</li>
      </ol>

      Pick-and-place for the vials was accomplished with an Epson SCARA robot, while
      rejecting was done with a blower at the end of the line. The unreliability of the
      carton infeed mechanism made speed the primary challenge, and meeting the specified
      rate required me to pre-fetch the vials and hover over position while waiting for
      the cartons to index. I got it up to over 80 parts per minute in the end, beating
      the requirement by a pretty wide margin.

    <h2>Bottler Interlocks</h2>
  
    <div style="width:100%; height:0; padding-top:56.25%; position:relative;">
      <img alt="Bottling Line" src="/api/projects/industrial_automation/bottling_interlocks.jpg"
        style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100%;" />
    </div>

    <p>
      This line does a lot. Bottles go though stations for:

      <ol>
        <li>Sanitization.</li>
        <li>Filling.</li>
        <li>Capping.</li>
        <li>Inspection.</li>
        <li>Metal detection.</li>
        <li>Wrapping.</li>
        <li>Sealing.</li>
        <li>Labeling.</li>
      </ol>

      Most of the line was in place before I started work on it, but none of the components
      were talking to each other. The metal detector could go down and the capper would keep
      going like nothing happened, and that's a problem. 
      <br><br>
      My role was to program a PLC to turn each component on and off according to certain
      criteria like "if the conveyor stops, raise the heat tunnel". While I was at it, I was
      also asked to add an HMI, program the post-capper inspection camera, and program the
      reject setup.
