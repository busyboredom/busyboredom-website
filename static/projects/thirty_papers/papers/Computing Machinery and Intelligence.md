### Day 1: Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950)
#### **The Imitation Game**
- Turing replaces the vague question, "Can machines think?" with a concrete test: the Imitation Game.
- In the test, a human interrogator tries to tell the difference between a human and a machine based on their typed conversational responses.
- The goal is to focus on intellectual and behavioral imitation, making the machine's physical form irrelevant.
#### **The Machine in Question**
- Turing focuses specifically on "universal digital computers."
- He argues their universal nature is key, as one machine can be programmed to mimic any other, eliminating the need for specialized hardware.
#### **Objections & Rebuttals**
- Turing systematically dismantles common objections to the idea of machine intelligence.
- He argues that claims about a machine's inability to have consciousness, show originality, or feel emotion are often based on observing primitive machines or are unsolvable philosophical problems (like solipsism).
#### **The Path Forward: Learning Machines**
- Instead of programming an adult mind with fixed rules, Turing suggests a more promising approach: creating a "child-machine."
- This machine would start with basic mechanisms and then be taught, learning and developing its intelligence through education and experience in a process he likens to evolution.
#### **Turing's Prediction**
- He famously predicted that by the year 2000, computers would play the game so well that an average interrogator would have only a 70% chance of correctly identifying the machine after five minutes.
