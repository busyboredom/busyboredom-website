  <h1>30 Papers in 30 Days</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    To prepare for a potential Master's or PhD in Artificial Intelligence,
    I need to build a strong foundational knowledge of the current research
    landscape. While I have an extensive background in software engineering, I
    lack formal research experience. This project is a self-imposed challenge to
    bridge that gap by <em>reading and summarizing one AI research paper every
    day for 30 days.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    My notes will be shared below. They probably won't be updated same-day, so
    depending on when you look at this it could appear a bit behind, but I'll
    do my best to get them all up here shortly after the end of this 30 day
    experiment on July 30th, 2025. They also may be a bit informal since I'm
    primarily doing this for myself; providing value to you through this blog is
    only a secondary goal.

  <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>

  <p>
    This challenge is as much about discipline and consistency as it is about AI. I
    hope that by the end of these 30 days, I will have a much clearer picture of the
    field and be better prepared for the next stage of my academic journey.
