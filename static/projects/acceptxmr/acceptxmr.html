    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <i>(Last updated for AcceptXMR v0.12.0)</i>

    <p>
        Are you a privacy-loving entrepreneur, looking for a way to accept
        payment in
        <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> in an automated fashion?
        I wrote a rust crate just for you!
        <br><br>
        AcceptXMR generates unique subaddresses for each invoice so you'll know
        what you're being paid for when a user sends you Monero. It then scans
        the blockchain for incoming transactions using your private viewkey so
        you'll know within seconds when a user pays. Here are some features of
        my crate:
    <ul>
        <li>View pair only, no hot wallet.</li>
        <li>Subaddress based (as opposed to the older integrated
            addresses).</li>
        <li>Pending invoices can be stored persistently, enabling recovery from
            power loss.</li>
        <li>Number of confirmations is configurable per-invoice.</li>
        <li>Ignores transactions with timelocks.</li>
        <li>Minimal, intuitive API (in my totally unbiased opinion).</li>
    </ul>

    about how I tackled this project.
    </p>

    <h2>Public API</h2>
    <p>
        AcceptXMR's public interface, or API, is deceptively simple. You create
        a
        <code>PaymentGateway</code> when your application starts up, create a
        new
        <code>Invoice</code> when a user goes to checkout, and subscribe to
        invoice updates with a
        <code>Subscriber</code> to know when they've paid. The following bit of
        code shows a very simple example, just to give you an idea of what the
        interface looks like.
    <pre>
        <code>
// Create the payment gateway.
let payment_gateway = PaymentGateway::builder(
    private_view_key, 
    primary_address,
    InMemory::new()
)
.build()?;

// Run the payment gateway.
payment_gateway.run()?;

// Oh hey, a customer is checking out!
let invoice_id = payment_gateway.new_invoice(
    100 * 10 ** 9,                    // We'll charge 100 millineros,
    0,                                // require 0 confirmations,
    10,                               // expire in 10 blocks,
    "Large Cheese Pizza".to_string()  // and get the order right.
)?;

// We can now subscribe to updates to the pizza invoice.
let subscriber = payment_gateway.subscribe(invoice_id)?
    .expect("invoice doesn't exist");

// Have we been paid yet?
let update = subscriber.recv().await.expect("channel closed");

if update.is_confirmed() {
    // Great, ship the pizza and stop tracking the invoice.
    println!("Invoice for \"{}\" paid", update.description());
    payment_gateway.remove_invoice(invoice_id)?;
}       </code>
    </pre>
    Pretty sweet, right? This simple interface is made possible by a few key
    components under the hood. Read the next section for more details on what
    these components are and how they work together.
    </p>

    <h2>Internal Architecture</h2>
    <div style="width:100%; height:0; padding-top:73.27%; position:relative;">
        <img alt="Architectural Diagram" src="/api/projects/acceptxmr/diagram.webp" style="position:absolute;
        top:0; left:0; width:100%;">
    </div>
    <p>
        The image above shows a high-level overview of how the pieces of
        AcceptXMR talk to each other. Aside from the subscribers and payment
        gateway you see in the public API, AcceptXMR contains a "scanning
        thread" which watches for transactions on the blockchain, three caching
        objects for holding onto relevant information while it scans, and an
        interface to any storage layer implementation your heart desires. I'll
        step through each component now and briefly describe its purpose and
        operation.
    </p>

    <h3>Scanning Thread</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The scanning thread is spawned by the payment gateway when
        <code>run()</code> is called. It periodically fetches new blocks and
        transactions from a Monero daemon of your choosing and caches them in
        the block and txpool caches. It then scans them for any transactions
        relevant to pending invoices and updates those invoices in the database.
    </p>
    <h3>Block Cache</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The block cache exists to provide some resistance to blockchain
        reorganizations. If a new block is added which does not build on the
        current highest block in the cache, we know that a reorganization has
        occurred an can begin working our way down the block cache to discover
        how deep the reorganization is. We then re-scan all blocks higher than
        that reorganization depth and update pending invoices accordingly.
    </p>
    <h3>Txpool Cache</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The txpool (transaction pool) cache was not originally a part of
        AcceptXMR but was added as an optimization after a peculiar influx of
        very large transactions caused a very noticeable decrease in the
        performance of the scanning thread. Prior to the addition of the txpool
        cache, the full txpool was being fetched and scanned each cycle. This
        meant we were re-scanning transactions (extra CPU load) and also
        re-downloading them (extra network load). The addition of a txpool cache
        allowed AcceptXMR to only fetch and scan <i>new</i>
        transactions each cycle.
    </p>
    <h3>Subaddress Cache</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The subaddress cache contains pre-generated subaddresses. When a new
        invoice is created, a random subaddress is removed from the cache and
        used for that invoice. When the invoice is removed, the subaddress is
        returned to the cache. This ensures that no two invoices use the same
        subaddress at the same time, allowing AcceptXMR to reliably
        differentiate between payments by different customers. Additionally, if
        there are a large number customers checking out at once and the cache
        begins to run low on available subaddresses, new addresses will be
        generated in batches to replenish it.
    </p>
    <h3>Pending Invoices Database</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The pending invoices database holds all invoices which have not yet been
        removed using
        <code>payment_gateway.remove_invoice(invoice_id)</code>. This was done
        to enable AcceptXMR to recover from sudden power loss. When AcceptXMR
        starts up, it checks the database for any pending invoices and resumes
        scanning where it left off so that no customer's payment will go
        unprocessed.
        <br><br>
        If the built-in <code>Sqlite</code>, <code>Sled</code> and
        <code>InMemory</code> storage options don't fit your needs, you are free
        to implement the <code>InvoiceStorage</code> trait on any storage layer
        implementation you desire.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This project has been a success. AcceptXMR works and it was a lot of fun
        to make. I plan on adding a few features in the future (like ZMQ support
        as an optional replacement for periodic scanning) but everything
        necessary to accept Monero is present, performant and easy to use.
