  <h1>MNIST Tutorial</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    This is an IEEE-style writing sample which I think may be useful to anyone hoping to learn
    Tensorflow. The paper itself was written in 
    <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>,
    and you can see how I did that 
    <a href="https://github.com/busyboredom/MNISTpaper">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    While this format might not be the usual for tutorials, I think you will find it
    incredibly thorough and easy to follow. Go ahead and print it out, and read with a
    pen in your hand. If you decide you like this kind of programming, the ability to read
    IEEE papers (and similar) will come in handy.

  <h2>Why This Was Written</h2>

  <p>
    I took a neural networks class in college, and was unfortunately disappointed in how
    little modern tools/techniques were used in the class. We learned about <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network">Hopfield</a>
    networks, <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCullochâ€“Pitts_neuron">McCulloch-Pitts</a>
    neurons and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function">radial
    basis function</a>, but we never got to solve any real problems or use any tools of
    the trade. This disappointment lead to a sub-par homework grade for me, and my
    professor gave me a way out: <em>do something modern, and write a paper about it</em>.
    <br><br>
    The paper below is what I wrote. The task of classifying handwritten digits is
    commonly referred to as the "hello world" of machine learning, and isn't an impressive
    feat in itself. However, the use of convolutional neural networks and <a
    href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow 2.0</a> make this exercise incredibly
    useful from a learning perspective -- <em>and incredibly brief</em>. Anyone can train
    a neural network to read handwritten digits with greater than 99% accuracy in fewer
    than 50 lines of code with these tools.
