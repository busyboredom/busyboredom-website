    <h2>Summary</h2>
  
    <p>
      Ever gotten a homework assignment and immediately written it off as a loss? 
      <br><br>
      Optimizing this cascaded BJT amplifier was one of those for me. Calculating the 
      charactaristics of a given amplifier is relatively straight forward, but taking a set of 
      desired parameters and turning it into a design is another matter. Interestingly though, the 
      issue is not a lack of knobs to turn -- it's that changing one of them influences the impact
      of a change in another. Asking my professor for guidence got me a frustrating answer: try 
      different combinations until you find one that works.
      <br><br>
      I don't know about you, but that sounds like computer work to me. There are a number of ways
      to tackle a search problem like this. A simple grid search would probably work fine, and a 
      baysian search might work a little better. If you want the "wow" factor though, you use a 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm" >genetic algorithm</a>.

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
  
    <p>
      The most efficient way to solve a problem like this would be analytically as a system of 
      equations. Being motivated by laziness, however, that solution won't suffice. A black box 
      optimization strategy like a genetic algorithm may not have the shortest run time, but our
      goal is to minimize study time. 
      <br><br>
      Genetic algorithms are fairely intuitive optimizers. Given some function and a "loss 
      function" describing the desired output, a genetic algorithm first randomly generates a set
      of possible inputs. For this use case, the inputs are the resistor and Vcc values. The code
      below shows how I randomly generate the inputs according to a configurable probability 
      distribution.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
void Amplifier::Randomize() {
  // Randomizes the amplifier.

  // Set up random number generation.
  std::random_device rd;  // Get random number from hardware.
  std::mt19937 eng(rd());  // Seed the generator.
  // Define Distributions.
  std::uniform_int_distribution<> resistor_distribution(0, max_resistor);
  std::uniform_int_distribution<> Vcc_distribution(1, max_Vcc);

  // Set random Vcc and resistor values.
  Vcc = Vcc_distribution(eng);
  R1 = resistor_distribution(eng);
  R2 = resistor_distribution(eng);
  R3 = resistor_distribution(eng);
  R4 = resistor_distribution(eng);
  Rc1 = resistor_distribution(eng);
  Re1 = resistor_distribution(eng);
  Re2 = resistor_distribution(eng);
}
      </code>
    </pre>
    
    <p>
      After a population of inputs are randomized, each set is passed through a function and the
      results are ranked in order from best to worst according to the loss function. In our case,
      the function is a set of BJT amplifier equations and the loss function is a combination of
      amplifier charactaristics. The code block below shows the process of calculating the voltage
      gain of the amplifier (one of the many variables that a user may want to optimize for).

//Av-----------------------------------

void Amplifier::calculate_Av() {
  Av = Avs * Av1 * Av2;
}

void Amplifier::calculate_Avs() {
  Avs = Rin / (parameters::Rsource + Rin);
}

void Amplifier::calculate_Av1() {
  double beta = parameters::beta;
  double Rload = parameters::Rload;
  double numerator;
  double denominator;
  // numerator = (Rc1||Rth2||(Rpi2 + (beta + 1)(Re2||Rload)
  numerator = beta * 
    1 / (1/Rc1 + 1/Rth2 + 1/(Rpi2 + (beta + 1) * 1 / (1/Re2 + 1/Rload)));
  denominator = Rpi1;
  Av1 = numerator / denominator;
}

void Amplifier::calculate_Av2() {
  double beta = parameters::beta;
  double Rload = parameters::Rload;
  double numerator;
  double denominator;
  // numerator = (beta + 1)(Re2||Rload)
  numerator = (beta + 1) * 1 / (1/Re2 + 1/Rload);
  denominator = Rpi2 + (beta + 1) * 1 / (1/Re2 + 1/Rload);
  Av2 = numerator / denominator;
}

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  
    This project was a cornerstone of my early education, and I highly recommend building your own if
    you have the time and money. Alternatively, if you're a parent, maybe consider doing something
    like this with your kids. Give them a "grant", let them take the ropes and see what they come up 
    with.
