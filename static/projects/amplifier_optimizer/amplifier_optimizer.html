    <h2>Summary</h2>
  
    <p>
      This was one of my earliest electronics projects, and significantly influenced my decision
      when choosing my majors in college. The amplifier_optimizer fits the common 250 mm form factor and
      runs on a 3-cell (12.6 V) lithium polymer battery, but the best part was the onboard camera 
      and video transmitter, letting the pilot see what the drone sees in real time. I even 
      got a headset for it.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Breakdown</h2>
  
    <p>
      This amplifier_optimizer was meant to be a platform to be tinkered with. To accomodate that, I wanted to
      spec out standard and stand-alone components that could be swapped out independently.

      <li><h3>Camera, PSU, Transmitter and Antenna</h3></li>
  
      Cameras are delicate instruments. The steel housing helps protect my Pilot V2 camera from
      impact, but isn't enough to protect the image quality from the electrical interference coming
      from the motors and ESCs. To provide some electrical protection, the camera got its own little
      filtered power supply. The video transmitter draws from this filtered power as well, and sports
      a circular polerized antenna to cut down on interference from other nearby signals as well.
  
      <li><h3>Battery</h3></li>
  
      Lithium polymer batteries give an specific energy of between 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_polymer_battery">100–265 Wh/kg</a>. 
      That might not be on par with the 13.0 kWh/kg you get out of gasoline, but it's a hell of a 
      lot better than the 35–40 Wh/kg you'll get out of something like the lead acid batteries used in
      cars. 
      
      <li><h3>ESCs and Motors</h3></li>
  
      The motors are a little special. You could use the normal brushed motors you might find in a
      cheap RC car, but you would end up disappointed in your flight times. Those motors draw a lot of
      power, and likely won't give you the thrust you're looking for. To do it right, you need
      brushless DC (BLDC) motors. 
      <br><br>
      Brushless DC motors are special because they're not really DC at all -- they're driven by a
      multi-phase AC signal similar to what you might find in big industrial machinery. Each input
      line oscillates at the same frequency, but slightly out of phase. To speed up the motor, you
      increase the frequency. 
      <br><br>
      You might have noticed that our power supply is a battery (a DC source). So how are we gonna get
      a high-power variable frequency signal out of a DC source? With an Electronic Speed Controller!
      ESCs take DC power and a control signal, and turn them into an alternating signal who's
      frequency is determined by that control signal. Each motor of my amplifier_optimizer has its own 10 A ESC,
      providing indevidual control over that motor and plenty of punch.
  
      <li><h3>Reciever and Flight Controller</h3></li>
  
      The reciever's role is simple: take input remotely from the operator. With a amplifier_optimizer,
      however, interpretation of that input requires some work. Humans don't generally have the
      reaction time necessary to manually control the speed of each motor, so controls are often
      simplified down to forward, backwards, left, right, faster, slower, and turn (or "yaw"). To
      translate these simple commands into actual motor speeds, I used a CC3D flight control module.
      This module has a built in accelerometer and gyroscope, allowing it to self-stabilize
      autonomously. Some basic calibration and PID tuning is all that's required after installation.   
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  
    This project was a cornerstone of my early education, and I highly recommend building your own if
    you have the time and money. Alternatively, if you're a parent, maybe consider doing something
    like this with your kids. Give them a "grant", let them take the ropes and see what they come up 
    with.
